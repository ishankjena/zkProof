## Zero Knowledge Proof
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are protocols that help prove the validity of statements on blockchains without offering information that may compromise privacy. They allow users to verify the validity of a transaction without revealing details of the transaction.

"A Zero-Knowledge Proof is a protocol by which one party (prover) can prove to another party (verifier) that a statement is True, without revealing any information about the statement, apart from the fact that it is True."
